/* ***************************** Factory design pattern *****************************
 * Provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
 * 
 * PROS:
 * - You avoid tight coupling between the creator and the concrete products.
 * - Single Responsibility Principle. You can move the product creation code into one place in the program, making the code easier to support.
 * - Open/Closed Principle. You can introduce new types of products into the program without breaking existing client code.
 * 
 * CONS: 
 * - The code may become more complicated since you need to introduce a lot of new subclasses to implement the pattern. The best case scenario is when youâ€™re introducing the pattern into an existing hierarchy of creator classes.
