package structural.adapter;

/* ***************************** Adapter design pattern *****************************
 * Allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.
 * 
 * PROS:
 * - Single Responsibility Principle. You can separate the interface or data conversion code from the primary business logic of the program.
 * - Open/Closed Principle. You can introduce new types of adapters into the program without breaking the existing client code, as long as they work with the adapters through the client interface.
 * 
 * CONS: 
 * - The overall complexity of the code increases because you need to introduce a set of new interfaces and classes. Sometimes itâ€™s simpler just to change the service class so that it matches the rest of your code.
