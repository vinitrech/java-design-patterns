/* ***************************** Bridge design pattern *****************************
 * Lets you split a large class or a set of closely related classes into two separate hierarchies—abstraction and implementation—which can be developed independently of each other.
 * 
 * PROS:
 * - You can create platform-independent classes and apps.
 * - The client code works with high-level abstractions. It isn’t exposed to the platform details.
 * - Open/Closed Principle. You can introduce new abstractions and implementations independently from each other.
 * - Single Responsibility Principle. You can focus on high-level logic in the abstraction and on platform details in the implementation.
 * 
 * CONS: 
 * - You might make the code more complicated by applying the pattern to a highly cohesive class.
