package structural.composite;

/* ***************************** Composite design pattern *****************************
 * Lets you compose objects into tree structures and then work with these structures as if they were individual objects.
 * 
 * PROS:
 * - You can work with complex tree structures more conveniently: use polymorphism and recursion to your advantage.
 * - Open/Closed Principle. You can introduce new element types into the app without breaking the existing code, which now works with the object tree.
 * 
 * CONS: 
 * - It might be difficult to provide a common interface for classes whose functionality differs too much. In certain scenarios, youâ€™d need to overgeneralize the component interface, making it harder to comprehend.
